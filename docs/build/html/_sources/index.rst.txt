FRApy: Fitting Resolved Arcs with python
#########################################

FRApy is python code designed to fit gravitational arcs in image plane with analytical modes, such as metallicity gradients and velocity fields, taking into account the lensing distortions.


Intro
=================================

Graviatational arcs
--------------------

Gravitational arcs are galaxies in the backgroud of a cluster of galaxies or a massive galaxy. These massive objects act as a *magnifying lens*, increasing the size of the backgroud galaxies in the sky, which allows us to resolve them to smaller spatial scales. However, the magnification is not uniform, and the lensed galaxies appear 'distorted' in the sky, typically in an arc-like shape (hence the name graviational 'arcs').

   :alt: Example of graviational arc.

   This is a gravitational arc called 'the dragon' lensed by the cluster Abell 370. On the left, you can see it in *image plane*, i.e. as it is in the sky, magnified it all its messy glory. On the right, we have use a lensing model to correct this magnification and get 'the real galaxy'. This is called the *source plane* image.



The spatial distortion makes the analysis of these objects more difficult, especially when several images of the same object (called multiple images) are available. FRApy deals with this issue through forward-modelling: we start with a model in source plane (the 'undistorted' galaxy), lense it to image plane using a lensing model and compare it with the data.


What you'll need
--------------------

1. Deflection maps. These are images produced from a lensing model that map how much deflection (in arcseconds) a little photon originated in position x,y in the sky will suffer due to the gravitational lens. This is the core of FRApy's modelling and allows us to generate lensed images that can be compared with the observations. We do this by calculating where each pixel in source plane will 'land' in image plane. A number of Frontier Fields models provide these maps, you can check them `here <https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/hlsp/frontier/abell370/models/>`_.


2. An analytical model that you hope describes your data, such as a gradient for metallicity or an arctangent model velocity fields. FRApy comes with a number of these models,
that we used in our own publications, but we also show how you can create and fit your own model.

Quick start
=================================

FRApy is a python module. A minimum working example would look something like this:

.. code-block:: python

	# Import FRApy
	from frapy import Observation,Metallicity_Gradient,fit_model,make_input_parameters,Output

	# Load Observations
	obs = Observation(z=0.611,
		              data_path='Demo_data/AS1063_map_metallicity.fits',
		              unc_path='Demo_data/AS1063_map_metallicity_unc.fits',
		              seeing = 1.03/0.2)

	# Choose a Model, in this case a linear metallicity gradient
	model = Metallicity_Gradient(zlens=0.322,
					 dfx_path='Demo_data/AS1063_dplx.fits',
					 dfy_path='Demo_data/AS1063_dply.fits')
	model.create_projection_maps(obs)

	# Fit the data
	input_par = make_input_parameters(name    = ('cx', 'cy',  'q', 'pa', 'z_grad', 'z_0'),
			 value   = (  29,   23,  0.7,   20,    -0.02, 9.0),
			 minimum = (  28,   22,  0.4,  -20,     -0.1, 8.5),
			 maximum = (  33,   27,  0.9,   90,      0.0, 9.5))
	out = fit_model(obs,model,input_par,'output_file',nsteps=2000,nwalkers=24)

	# Inspect the fit
	results = Output('output_file')
	results.best_parameters()
